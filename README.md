# üöó Vahaka - Driver Booking Platform

Welcome to the Vahaka Driver Booking platform! This repository contains two distinct yet interconnected applications:

1. üì± **Vahaka App** - Mobile application for users who want to book drivers
2. üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è **Vahaka Partner** - Mobile application for drivers who provide services

## üìã Project Overview

Vahaka is a comprehensive driver booking platform that connects passengers with professional drivers. The platform consists of two main applications:

### üß≠ Vahaka App (User Application)

An intuitive mobile application built with React Native and Expo where users can:
- Browse and search for available drivers
- Filter drivers by trip type (Business, Weekly, Urgent, Outstation)
- Book drivers for specific dates and durations
- Manage bookings and view booking history
- Manage their profile and payment methods
- Rate and review drivers

### üöò Vahaka Partner (Driver Application)

A dedicated mobile application for drivers to:
- Create and manage their professional profile
- Set their availability and pricing
- Manage their vehicle and license information
- Accept or reject booking requests
- Track their earnings and reviews
- Toggle online/offline status

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The Vahaka platform is built with modern technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - React Native / Expo
  - TypeScript
  - Expo Router for navigation
  - Linear Gradient for UI effects
  - Custom UI components

- **Backend**:
  - Firebase Authentication
  - Firestore Database
  - Firebase Storage
  - Cloud Functions (for notifications)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up both applications for development.

   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the backend server required for the app to function properly. Keep this terminal window open while running the frontend.

3. **Install frontend dependencies** (in a new terminal window):
   ```bash
   cd vahaka-app/frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Firebase**:

   - Create a Firestore database in a region close to your users
   - Set up storage for profile images
   
5. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the `vahaka-app/frontend` directory
   - Add your Firebase configuration:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain

   EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   ```

6. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

7. **Launch on a device or emulator**:
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device
   - Press 'a' to launch on Android emulator or 'i' for iOS simulator

### üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Vahaka Partner (Driver App) Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **bookings**: Booking records between users and drivers
- **vehicles**: Vehicle information
- **reviews**: User reviews for drivers

## üí° Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Firebase Authentication Issues
- **API Key Not Valid**: Ensure your Firebase API key is correct in environment files
- **Firebase App Already Exists**: The app handles multiple initialization attempts

#### Firestore Permission Errors
- Check Firestore security rules
- Ensure the user is properly authenticated before accessing Firestore

#### Expo Build Issues
- Clear cache with `expo start --clear`
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed

#### Backend Connection Issues
- Make sure the backend server is running (`npm run dev` in the vahaka-app/backend directory)
- Both backend and frontend servers must be running simultaneously for full functionality
- Check that your environment configuration points to the correct backend URL
